# js_recap

JS_Recap is a small refresher, challenge, and/or exercise focusing on vanilla JS. Projects are small and intentionally (mostly) limited to one HTML page. Project ideas are from [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/). 

The site structure is from HTML5 UP... I've been looking for a reason to work with one of the templates because they're pretty, light, clean, and easily customizeable. 

To see the project in action, please visit [minijsrecap.herokuapp.com](https://minijsrecap.herokuapp.com/index.html).
