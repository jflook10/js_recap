# js_recap

JS_Recap (this repo) is a small refresher, challenge, and/or exercise focusing on vanilla JS. Projects are small and intentionally (mostly) limited to one HTML page. Project ideas are from Wes Bos. 

The site structure is from HTML5 UP... I've been looking for a reason to work with one of the templates because they're pretty, light, clean, and easily customizeable.
